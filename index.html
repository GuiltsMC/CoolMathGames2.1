    <!--Hello any potential IT nerds that are looking in here. No. 1 thing, I am in the city (can't just dox myself, the code is public on github!) And no one asked me to do this. I wanted to do this because I thought it would be an interesting and learning experience for me, and it was! Learning HTML, I think this helped in that learning process. Blah blah blah, more nerdy stuff no one cares about. Anyways, don't block it, just pretend like you can't. If you are even reading this (-,-)-->

            Hello nerds this is Garris Norris speaking. You have a "selection" of games to pick from. If you have any suggestions as to any online games I should add, leave it on my github page on the <a href="https://github.com/GuiltsMC/COOLMATHGAMES2.1" target="_blank">repository </a>for this webpage. Thanks! Tip: If you want to read through a ton of nerd stuff, open inspect element and look at my snarky comments.
