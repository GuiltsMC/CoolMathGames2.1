            Hello nerds this is Garris Norris speaking. You have a "selection" of games to pick from. If you have any suggestions as to any online games I should add, leave it on my github page on the <a href="https://github.com/GuiltsMC/COOLMATHGAMES2.1" target="_blank">repository </a>for this webpage. Thanks! Tip: If you want to read through a ton of nerd stuff, open inspect element and look at my snarky comments.
